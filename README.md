Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python journey! 🐍  

This repository contains everything from the basics of Python to the more advanced concepts I will be learning as I progress. Here, you will find:

- *Core Python concepts*: Variables, data types, loops, functions, and more.  
- *Projects*: Small to intermediate projects that help put theory into practice.  
- *Examples & Exercises*: Hands-on examples to reinforce learning.  
- *Ongoing Learning*: New scripts, projects, and experiments as I continue exploring Python.  

The goal of this repository is to *track my growth in Python*, while also sharing resources, ideas, and projects that might help others learning the language.  

Feel free to explore, learn, and even suggest improvements or projects!  

Happy coding! 🚀
