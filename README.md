# Basic Print and Input in Python

This is my first Python learning repository.  
In this repo, I practiced:

- Printing text and numbers with print()
- Using \n for new lines
- Taking user input with input()
- Greeting the user by name

## Example Code

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello",Â name)
